    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A population of individuals is created, where each individual represents a set of hyperparameters (C and gamma in this case).\n",
    "2. Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each individual is evaluated using the evaluate function, which trains an SVM and computes its cross-validation accuracy.\n",
    "3. Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The best individuals are selected for the next generation using tournament selection.\n",
    "4. Crossover and Mutation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crossover and mutation are applied to create new individuals (offspring).\n",
    "5. Iteration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process is repeated for a fixed number of generations.\n",
    "6. Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "- At the end, the best individual (i.e., the best set of hyperparameters) and its performance score are printed."
