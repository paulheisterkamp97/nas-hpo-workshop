    "# Hyperband and Successive Halving\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Successive Halving:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successive Halving is a resource-efficient algorithm that allocates resources (e.g., time, data, or iterations) to multiple configurations and eliminates the worst-performing ones at each step.\n",
    "- It starts by testing many configurations with minimal resources and progressively allocates more resources to the most promising configurations.\n",
    "#### Hyperband:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperband extends Successive Halving by dynamically adjusting the allocation of resources based on the trade-off between the number of configurations tested and the resources allocated to each configuration.\n",
    "- It uses a parameter called R (maximum resources per configuration) to balance exploration and exploitation."
